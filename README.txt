This is the directory containing riblet systems used for the proper simulations.

The first one, prism riblet will be based on test_riblet_v5.

The velocity boundary conditions have been modified so that it now has lid-driven, or couette flow.

Hopefully this means we can reduce the inlet length, so I've changed it from 2000 to 500.

Also changed the phase names from water -> biofilm and air -> fluid. Hopefully this should be somewhat less confusing.
